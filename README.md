# Uranium Beavers Game Lab
Uranium Beavers Game Lab,
This website is meant to show the various games and projects i am working on in Unity engine, while also 
providing a shorty story or blurb to give the viewer an idea of what the game is about. 
The target audience is meant to be gamers all around the world. The website's purpose is to 
inspire some excitment around the games I am creating within that target audience by displaying the cheapcosts of 
the games (when they're released) as well as what the game is actually about and other details about each game. (all images and intellectual property of descriptions and so forth are mine).
# Existing Features
The features of this page include the following:
- A Table of contents for the viewer to be able to navigate to each game as well as see the cost of each game and the platform(s) they'll be released on.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/131336843-116bfb4e-8707-4a38-86fb-8952ef5d6ccb.png)
- A description of each games narrative with accompanying front cover/box art, basically to get gamers interested, as well as a return to table link that brings the user back to the table of contents.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/131337036-e06aade4-6505-437d-a34c-fb631c32471c.png)
- A display of the art and some images of each game, with an emphasis on colour so that it catches the users eye.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/131337240-4c5e8b4a-96d6-42b9-a212-1eeb811190c5.png)
- A sign up form which allows the viewer to sign up their email for future updates in regard to which game.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87052254/131337413-98bca416-76d2-4e6a-b772-bdec87a5d3f6.png)
# Testing
The main thing tested with this site was firstly that all internal links worked and directed the user to the correct part of the page. This was tested multiple times throughout the project to ensure functionality.
The second thing that required a fair bit of testing was the screensizing when it came to the pixel art images featured within the website. Because the majority of the images are pixel art it was hard to determine how pixelated would be reasonable. Another major thing within that needed testing was the styling of the page itself as throughout the project i often changed the styles of multiple elements so it fitted more with the page, often at times this would break and cause the entire page to change in a way that i didn't expect. Another thing that required constant testing was the form element at the end of the page which went through various stages in order to get where it is now. However, all things considered i am very happy with the outcome of all the features within the webpage.
# Validator Testing
- HTML No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- CSS No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

# Unfixed Bugs
There were no unfixed bugs that i am aware of but a worthy mention would be that my submit input type was broken and would autofill an email for the email section of the form. This was later fixed however.
# Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
- The Link for this deployment is here https://Website-HTML-Essentials.harryhs25.repl.co
# Credits
The main credits i used were for stylising my table and form, this was taken from W3 schools, https://www.w3schools.com/.
All images and descriptions are mine except for when i reference other games and movies which are evidently not mine.
