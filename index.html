    <h3 id="DistantRift">Distant Rift</h3>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <a href="#ProjectTable">Back to table</a>
    <p>Distant rift is a sci-fi 2D survival, platformer, with an openworld and horror elements. The game starts following the aftermath of humanity's war with a civilization of aliens. Jason Jones (the protagonist and a war veteran) is tasked by a journalist company, he joined after the war, to investigate a restricted system after a missing ship returned from the system with the pilot mutilated beyond repair. After he makes his way to the system his ships onboard systems malfunction and he ends up stranded on the frozen abndoned shipscrapyard planet of Yatok, he uses his journalist equipment to document his discoveries and survival on the planet. However, the planet is not what it seems...</p>
      <p>The art style or stylised direction for the game is meant to use dark colours and have very ominous music (as to fit with the horror theme), while having similar pixel art to that of terraria. The general theme of the game is very rustic. it is set on a scarp yard planet and will feature very rustic combat as weapons break and ammo as well as food is scarce.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <a href="#ProjectTable">Back to table</a>
    <p>Gods Canvas is a superhero comic book choose your own adventure game which looks at the darker side of superheros, and asks the question "does absolute powe corrupt absolutley?" The game follows the story of Kyle and his twin brother kyle as they discover they are not from this world and must save earth from a cataclysmic event brought by another alien race that destroyed their previous home and parents. Kyle and Arthur then disagree on how to prepare earth for the eventuasl arrival of their arch enemy as they realise the impact their powers have on the world, how humans perceive them and their god like powers.<p>
      <p>The art style for this game is that of a sterotypical superhero comic book and seeks to challenge the stereotypical superhero mindset through this type of media. As such it features bright colours and has a lot of graphic content as it is meant to be a true representation of the consequences of superpowers.<P>

    <h3 id="AcrossTheRiver">Across The River</h3>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <a href="#ProjectTable">Back to table</a>
    <p>Across the river is a 2D post apocolyptic Role playing game that takes place after what we know as human civilization was destroyed to a cataclysmic event known as <em>The Eruption</em>. After this event happened a war followed what was left all major nations for basic resources like water. Following this war nothing remains of human civilization except for the mysterious city across the river. The player who is born on the outside of this city must guide members of their tribe and infiltrate this city in order to survive as they are starving and consistently pursued by bandits. However, the city is not what it seems...</p>
    <p>The art direction for the game is meant to be pixelated and 2D similar to a mix of This War of Mine and Terraria. The player must make game changing decisions as they effectivley decide who from their tribe lives and dies. Due to the grim reality of the game the colours are typically darker and feature more browns and greys.
